- **Features**:
  - Integrated log viewer with debug status indicators
  - Visual identification of loggers with debug mode enabled
  - Security audit log integration with read-only access
  - Real-time log monitoring and filtering
  - Error boundary integration for comprehensive error tracking

### 9. **Error Boundary System**

- **Files**: `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`, `src/components/ClientErrorBoundary.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive error handling with detailed error reporting
  - Client-side error boundary for React component errors
  - Error demonstration component for testing error handling
  - Integration with logging system for error tracking

### 10. **Application-level Permissions**

- **File**: `src/services/provider/PermissionService.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Fine-grained control of sensitive actions
  - Permission checks before critical operations
  - User-configurable permission settings
  - Integration with biometric authentication

## 🔍 Security Implementation Details

- **Local Storage**:
  - All wallet data is stored locally on the device
  - Optional encryption of sensitive information
  - User control over data persistence
- **Encryption Implementation**:
  - AES-256-GCM (authenticated) encryption of private keys and seed phrases
  - Argon2id password-based key derivation (memory-hard, run in WebAssembly), tuned so an unlock takes a few hundred milliseconds
  - Self-describing versioned ciphertext: each blob records the KDF and its parameters in a header, so older scrypt/CryptoJS blobs still decrypt and are transparently re-encrypted to the current format on the next successful unlock
  - Client-side only operations with proper error handling

- **Authentication Flow**:
  - Authentication and wallet verification occur entirely on the device
  - WebAuthn/FIDO2 support for biometric authentication
  - Secure local storage of authentication credentials

### 2. **Biometric Security**:

- **Authentication Methods**:
  - Fingerprint (most devices)
  - Face ID (iOS, newer Android)
  - Security Key (when available)
  - Password fallback (always available)

- **Implementation**:
  - WebAuthn/FIDO2 standards
  - Public key credentials
  - No biometric data leaves the device

### 3. **Security Settings**:

1. **Biometric Configuration**:
   - Enable/disable biometric auth
   - Require for all transactions
   - Require for high-value transactions
   - Configure trusted devices

2. **Auto-lock Settings**:
   - Timeout duration
   - Lock on browser close
   - Lock on tab switch
   - Lock on network change

3. **Security Statistics**:
   - Authentication success rates
   - Lock/unlock frequency
   - Security event summaries

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

1. **Access Security Settings**:
   - Go to Wallet Settings → Security Settings
   - Configure biometric authentication
   - Set auto-lock timeout preferences

2. **Enable Biometric Auth**:
   - Toggle biometric authentication in settings
   - Test authentication capability
   - Configure transaction requirements

3. **Monitor Security**:
   - Security events are logged locally on the device (nothing is sent to a server)
   - Monitor unlock attempts in security panel

4. **Manual Security Actions**:
   - Manual wallet lock via settings
   - Force unlock with password/biometric

## 📋 Security Types

All security-related TypeScript interfaces are defined in `src/types/security.ts`:

- `BiometricCapabilities` - Device biometric support
- `SecuritySettings` - User security preferences
- `SecurityState` - Current security status
- `AutoLockSettings` - Auto-lock configuration

## 🔐 Security Best Practices Implemented

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of authentication and data protection
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Authentication only when necessary
- **Client-Side Security**: All sensitive operations and data handling occurs locally on the device
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Every request is authenticated and authorized properly
- **Privacy by Design**: Wallet addresses and sensitive data are properly anonymized
- **Secure by Default**: Security features are enabled by default
