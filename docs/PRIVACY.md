## Core Privacy Principles

The Avian FlightDeck Wallet implements these fundamental privacy principles:

1. **Data Minimization**: We collect and store only what's absolutely necessary
2. **No User-Wallet Linking**: We avoid creating permanent links between user accounts and wallet addresses
3. **Cryptographic Verification**: Wallet ownership is verified through signatures, not database records
4. **Local Verification**: Critical security checks happen locally on the device
5. **Data Truncation**: Identifiers are truncated or hashed when stored in audit logs
6. **No User Tracking**: We do not track users across different sessions or devices
7. **Transparent Data Handling**: All data collection and processing is documented

## Data Protection Measures

### Client-Side Security

- Private keys never leave the user's device
- Encryption with user-provided passwords
- Local storage with strong encryption

### Client-Side Security

- No storage of unencrypted private keys or seeds
- Secure local storage for all sensitive data
- Minimal storage of sensitive information

## Wallet Address Privacy

### Privacy-Preserving Storage

The application implements several privacy-preserving techniques:

1. **Local Only Storage**: Wallet addresses and keys never leave your device
2. **Password Encryption**: User-provided passwords encrypt sensitive data
3. **Ownership Verification**: Cryptographic signatures verify ownership locally

### Implementation

The wallet privacy implementation uses:

```typescript
// Example of local signature verification
const isOwner = verifyWalletSignature(walletAddress, message, signature);
```

### Local Storage Structure

The IndexedDB storage structure is designed for privacy:

- Separate object stores for different data types
- Encrypted wallet data in secure stores
- No linkage between sensitive data points

## Notification Privacy

The client-side notification system provides enhanced privacy through:

- All notification preferences stored locally in the browser
- No server-side storage of notification settings or preferences
- No transmission of wallet addresses for notification purposes
- Fully local processing of notification triggers via browser's Notification API

For complete details on the notification system, see [Notifications](NOTIFICATIONS.md).

## Audit Logging Privacy

Our local security audit logging implements these privacy protections:

1. **Identifier Truncation**: All identifiers (wallet addresses, device IDs) are truncated to show only enough information for debugging.
2. **Minimal Context**: Audit logs only record that a change happened, not the specific values changed.
3. **Local Storage Only**: Security logs are stored only on the user's device.
4. **User Control**: Users can clear logs at any time through the security settings.

## User Control

Users have comprehensive control over their data:

- Option to use encrypted or non-encrypted wallets
- Control over which wallets have notifications enabled
- Ability to clear local storage and reset the application
- Transparent activity logs showing recent security events
- Full control over data persistence with options to delete any stored data

## Testing Your Privacy

To verify the privacy protections are working:

1. Check the security audit logs to ensure no full identifiers are being stored
2. Use browser developer tools to examine IndexedDB storage content
3. Confirm that notification preferences are stored locally
4. Use browser network tools to verify that no sensitive data is transmitted
