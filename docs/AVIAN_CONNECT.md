# Avian Connect — Protocol Specification (Phase 1)

Avian Connect is the dApp connection surface of Avian FlightDeck. It lets an external web
application ask the user's wallet for their address and for a signature over a login challenge,
without the dApp ever seeing key material.

Phase 1 is **login-grade only**: connect, accounts, message signing, network identification.
There is no transaction signing, no PSBT signing, and no asset support in this phase — those
methods return `UNSUPPORTED_METHOD`.

The wallet endpoint is a single URL:

```
https://flightdeck.avn.network/connect
```

Two transports share that URL: a **popup** transport (desktop) and a **redirect** transport
(mobile / in-app browsers where popups are unreliable).

---

## 1. Security model

- **Keys never leave the wallet.** A dApp only ever receives an address, optionally a compressed
  public key (hex), and base64 signatures. Mnemonics, private keys, xprvs, and decrypted secrets
  are never placed in a `postMessage` payload or a redirect fragment.
- **Every signature requires two user actions**: an explicit approval screen showing the origin
  and the verbatim message, plus wallet authentication (password or biometric). "Remembering" a
  site skips the *connect* screen only — it never skips the *sign* screen and never skips
  authentication.
- **Origins are pinned per request.** In popup mode the wallet learns the origin from
  `MessageEvent.origin` of the first message from its opener and replies only to that origin —
  never `"*"`. In redirect mode the wallet requires `req.origin` to equal the origin of
  `redirect_uri`, so a site can only receive answers at its own origin.
- **Fragment, not query.** Redirect responses are returned in the URL fragment
  (`#avianconnect=…`), which browsers do not send to servers, keeping signatures out of server
  logs, proxies, and `Referer` headers.
- **The wallet is the source of truth for the origin.** Any `origin` a dApp writes into a request
  is only used in redirect mode, and only after being matched against `redirect_uri`. It is never
  trusted in popup mode.
- **Origins must be `https:`.** Plaintext `http:` is accepted only for `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`
  and `[::1]` so the demo and local development work. This applies to both transports: a popup
  message from a plaintext origin is ignored, and a plaintext `redirect_uri` is refused.

### What origin attestation does and does not give you

In popup mode the browser attests the origin: the value comes from `MessageEvent.origin` and
cannot be forged by page script. In redirect mode there is no equivalent browser attestation —
the wallet can only guarantee that the response is *delivered to* the origin named in the
request. A malicious site can therefore truthfully identify itself and receive its own answers,
but it cannot impersonate another site and receive that site's answers.

---

## 2. Envelopes

All messages are JSON objects carrying the version tag `avianConnect: 1`.

### 2.1 Request (dApp → wallet)

```jsonc
{
  "avianConnect": 1,
  "id": "a3f1c9d2",       // string, 1..128 chars, echoed back verbatim
  "method": "signMessage",
  "params": { "message": "…" },  // optional, object
  "origin": "https://realm.example"  // required in redirect mode, ignored in popup mode
}
```

Rules:

- `avianConnect` must be exactly the number `1`.
- `id` must be a non-empty string of at most 128 characters. Generate a fresh, unguessable id per
  request; the wallet echoes it so a dApp can match replies.
- `method` must be a non-empty string of at most 64 characters.
- `params`, when present, must be a plain object (not an array, not `null`).
- Anything else is rejected with `INVALID_REQUEST`.

### 2.2 Response (wallet → dApp)

Exactly one of `result` or `error` is present.

```jsonc
{ "avianConnect": 1, "id": "a3f1c9d2", "result": { "signature": "H9x…" } }
```

```jsonc
{ "avianConnect": 1, "id": "a3f1c9d2", "error": { "code": "USER_REJECTED", "message": "User rejected the request" } }
```

### 2.3 Events (popup transport only)

Events are unsolicited wallet → dApp messages. They carry no `id`.

```jsonc
{ "avianConnect": 1, "event": "accountsChanged", "data": { "accounts": ["R9…"] } }
```

| Event             | `data`                                    | Meaning                                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `accountsChanged` | `{ accounts: string[] }`                  | The accounts exposed to this origin changed (wallet switch, revocation). An empty array means the origin no longer has access. |
| `networkChanged`  | `{ network: string, genesisHash: string \| null }` | The active network changed. Phase 1 is mainnet-only, so this is emitted for completeness. |
| `disconnect`      | `{ reason: string }`                      | The wallet is tearing the session down (window closing, permission revoked). |

The redirect transport is single-shot — one request, one navigation back — so it carries no
events.

---

## 3. Methods (phase 1)

### `connect()`

Requests access to an account.

- **params**: none
- **result**: `{ address: string, publicKey?: string }`

The first call from an origin shows the connect approval screen, where the user picks which
wallet to expose and may tick "remember this site". Origins the user chose to remember resolve
silently on later calls. Origins that were approved without "remember" must approve again on the
next call.

`publicKey` (compressed, hex) is included only when the wallet already knows it for the exposed
address. The wallet learns it by recovering it from a signature the user has already authorised,
so it is typically absent on the first `connect()` and present afterwards. Treat it as optional.

### `getAccounts()`

- **params**: none
- **result**: `string[]`

Returns exactly the accounts the user exposed to *this* origin, never the wallet's full account
list. Requires an existing permission; otherwise `ORIGIN_NOT_APPROVED`.

### `signMessage({ message })`

- **params**: `{ message: string }` — non-empty, at most 8192 characters
- **result**: `{ signature: string }` — base64

Signs with the exposed account using the Avian message prefix
(`\x16Raven Signed Message:\n`), producing a signature verifiable by Avian Core and by
FlightDeck's Message Utilities → Verify tab.

Requires an existing permission, an explicit per-signature approval screen showing the origin and
the full untruncated message, and wallet authentication. There is no way to pre-approve
signatures.

A dApp login challenge should include the origin, a server nonce, and an expiry, e.g.:

```
realm.example wants you to sign in with your Avian address:
R9xy…

Nonce: 6f1a…
Issued At: 2026-08-10T12:00:00Z
```

### `signPsbt({ psbt })`

- **params**: `{ psbt: string }` — a base64 PSBT (BIP174), at most 100000 characters
- **result**: `{ psbt: string, complete: boolean, signedInputs: number }`

**Sign-only.** The wallet signs the inputs the connected account owns with Avian's
`SIGHASH_ALL | SIGHASH_FORKID` (`0x41`) sighash and hands the updated PSBT back. It **never
broadcasts** on a site's behalf — the dApp finalises and broadcasts (or hands the PSBT on to
another signer). `complete` is true when every input is now signed; `signedInputs` is how many
this wallet added.

Asset inputs are **never** signed (spending an Avian asset as a bare transfer would burn it), and
they are surfaced in the approval screen.

Requires an existing permission, an explicit per-request approval screen that **decodes the PSBT**
— showing each input and output, the total moved, the network fee, any asset, and how many inputs
the wallet will sign — and wallet authentication. There is no way to pre-approve signing. A PSBT
that does not parse is rejected without a prompt. The wallet does not select inputs or set the fee
for `signPsbt`; it signs exactly the transaction the dApp presents, so the dApp is responsible for
building a correct PSBT (see the wallet's own unsigned-PSBT export for the format).

### `getNetwork()`

- **params**: none
- **result**: `{ network: "mainnet", genesisHash: string | null }`

`genesisHash` is the mainnet genesis block hash as reported by the ElectrumX server the wallet is
connected to (`server.features` → `genesis_hash`), cached locally once learned. It is `null` when
the wallet has never been able to reach a server to learn it — dApps that pin a genesis hash
should treat `null` as "unknown", not as a mismatch.

This method identifies the chain and exposes nothing about the user, so it is the one method that
does not require a permission.

Phase 1 is mainnet-only; testnet is out of scope.

### `disconnect()`

- **params**: none
- **result**: `{ disconnected: true }`

Revokes this origin's permission. Idempotent — disconnecting an origin that was never connected
succeeds. In popup mode the wallet also emits a `disconnect` event.

### Unknown methods

Any method not listed above — including `sendTransaction` and asset operations — returns
`UNSUPPORTED_METHOD`. These are phase 2+ work.

## 4. Errors

| Code                  | When                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `USER_REJECTED`       | The user declined an approval screen, cancelled authentication, or closed the wallet window. |
| `ORIGIN_NOT_APPROVED` | The method needs a permission this origin does not have.                |
| `WALLET_LOCKED`       | The wallet is locked, or has no wallet set up yet.                      |
| `UNSUPPORTED_METHOD`  | Unknown method, or a method deferred to a later phase.                  |
| `INVALID_REQUEST`     | Malformed envelope, bad params, or a transport-level mismatch such as `redirect_uri` disagreeing with `req.origin`. |

Error messages are human-readable and may change; branch on `code`, not on `message`.

---

## 5. Popup transport (desktop)

1. The dApp opens `https://flightdeck.avn.network/connect` with `window.open`.
2. The dApp posts its request to the popup **repeatedly** (e.g. every 250 ms) until it receives a
   reply. There is no "wallet ready" broadcast, because broadcasting one would require posting to
   `"*"`; retrying instead keeps every wallet-originated message targeted at a known origin.
3. The wallet ignores any message whose `source` is not its opener. The first well-formed envelope
   from the opener pins the session origin to that message's `MessageEvent.origin`. Messages from
   any other origin are ignored for the lifetime of the window.
   Resending is safe: requests are deduplicated by `id`, so a retry that arrives while an approval
   screen is open is dropped, and a retry that arrives after the answer is replayed from the
   wallet's record rather than re-prompting the user. Reusing an `id` for a *different* request
   therefore returns the first answer — always generate a fresh one.
4. The wallet replies with `window.opener.postMessage(response, pinnedOrigin)`.
5. The dApp keeps the popup open to receive events and to issue further requests, or closes it.
   If the user closes the wallet window with a request outstanding, the wallet sends
   `USER_REJECTED` for the pending request and a `disconnect` event where it can.

Minimal client:

```js
const popup = window.open('https://flightdeck.avn.network/connect', 'avian-connect',
  'width=460,height=720');

function call(method, params) {
  const id = crypto.randomUUID();
  const req = { avianConnect: 1, id, method, params };
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const onMessage = (e) => {
      if (e.source !== popup) return;                       // must come from the popup
      if (e.origin !== 'https://flightdeck.avn.network') return; // must be the wallet's origin
      const msg = e.data;
      if (!msg || msg.avianConnect !== 1 || msg.id !== id) return;
      clearInterval(timer);
      window.removeEventListener('message', onMessage);
      msg.error ? reject(msg.error) : resolve(msg.result);
    };
    window.addEventListener('message', onMessage);
    const timer = setInterval(
      () => popup.postMessage(req, 'https://flightdeck.avn.network'),
      250,
    );
  });
}

const { address } = await call('connect');
const { signature } = await call('signMessage', { message: `Login to realm.example\nNonce: ${nonce}` });
```

A dApp **must** check both `e.source` and `e.origin` on every inbound message, exactly as above.

---

## 6. Redirect transport (mobile)

The dApp navigates the browser to:

```
https://flightdeck.avn.network/connect?req=<base64url(JSON request)>&redirect_uri=<urlencoded>
```

- `req` is the base64url encoding (RFC 4648 §5, unpadded) of the UTF-8 JSON request, and **must**
  include an `origin` field.
- `redirect_uri` must be an absolute `https:` URL (`http:` is allowed only for `localhost`
  development) whose origin equals `req.origin`. On mismatch the wallet shows an error and never
  redirects.

After the user approves or rejects, the wallet navigates to:

```
<redirect_uri>#avianconnect=<base64url(JSON response)>
```

Any fragment already present on `redirect_uri` is replaced. The response is the same envelope as
in popup mode. The dApp reads it on load:

```js
const raw = new URLSearchParams(location.hash.slice(1)).get('avianconnect');
if (raw) {
  const res = JSON.parse(new TextDecoder().decode(
    Uint8Array.from(atob(raw.replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/')), (c) => c.charCodeAt(0)),
  ));
  history.replaceState(null, '', location.pathname + location.search); // scrub the fragment
}
```

Each navigation carries exactly one request. To connect and then sign, perform two round trips —
and the user must choose to **remember** the site on the connect screen, because a one-shot
approval authorises only the request it was given and cannot outlive the navigation. If they do
not, the `connect()` still returns an address, but the follow-up `signMessage()` arrives at a
wallet with no record of the site and fails with `ORIGIN_NOT_APPROVED`. The connect screen says so
when it is reached over this transport.

---

## 7. Permissions

The wallet stores one record per origin in its local preferences (IndexedDB):

```ts
{ origin: string, accounts: string[], grantedAt: number, lastUsedAt: number }
```

- `origin` is a normalised scheme + host + port, lowercased, with no trailing slash.
- `accounts` holds only the addresses the user chose to expose to that origin.
- Records exist only for origins the user chose to **remember**. A one-shot approval authorises a
  single request and is not persisted.
- The user can review and revoke every record in **Settings → Connected Sites**. Revoking emits
  `accountsChanged` with an empty array (popup transport) and forces the next `connect()` to prompt
  again.

Permissions are per-origin, not per-wallet: switching the active wallet does not grant a site
access to the newly active wallet. The exposed accounts stay exactly as the user set them, and the
site is told via `accountsChanged`.

---

## 8. Versioning

`avianConnect: 1` is the phase-1 wire version. Additive changes (new methods, new optional result
fields, new event types) keep version `1`; a dApp must ignore unknown fields and unknown event
names. A breaking change would bump the number, and the wallet would then accept both for a
transition period.
