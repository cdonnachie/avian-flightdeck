## Configuration

### ElectrumX Server

The app connects to Avian ElectrumX servers for blockchain interaction. Currently configured for:

- Server: `electrum-us.avn.network:50003`
- Protocol: WebSocket Secure (WSS)

### PWA Settings

PWA configuration is handled in:

- `next.config.js` - Next.js PWA setup
- `public/manifest.json` - Web app manifest

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. Create service functions in appropriate service files
2. Add React components in the `components/` directory
3. Update the WalletContext if state changes are needed
4. Add proper TypeScript types

### Testing

- Test wallet operations with small amounts
- Verify PWA installation on different devices
- Test offline functionality
- Validate transaction signing and broadcasting

### Security Notes

- Never store unencrypted private keys
- Always validate user inputs
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper error handling for crypto operations

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests if applicable
5. Submit a pull request

## Security

This wallet is designed for small amounts and testing purposes. For large amounts:

- Verify all transactions carefully
- Keep backups of your private keys
- Use strong passwords for encryption
- Enable biometric authentication where available

### Biometric Security Notes

- Biometric credentials are device-specific and cannot be transferred between devices
- After restoring a backup on a new device, biometrics must be set up again
- Biometrics provide an additional security layer, but are not a replacement for strong passwords
- The app maintains information about which wallets had biometrics enabled to guide re-setup
